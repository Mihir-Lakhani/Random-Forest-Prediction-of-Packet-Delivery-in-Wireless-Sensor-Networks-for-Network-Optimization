## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Wireless Sensor Networks Overview

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) represent a fundamental technology in modern distributed computing systems, consisting of spatially distributed autonomous sensors that monitor physical or environmental conditions. These networks play crucial roles in various applications including environmental monitoring, industrial automation, smart cities, and Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. WSNs are characterized by resource constraints, including limited energy, processing power, and bandwidth, making network optimization paramount for sustained operation.

### 1.2 The Challenge of Packet Delivery Prediction

One of the most critical challenges in WSN management is predicting and optimizing packet delivery performance. Network latency directly impacts the quality of service (QoS) and overall network efficiency. Unpredictable latency can lead to:

- **Data Loss**: Critical sensor readings may become obsolete due to excessive delays
- **Energy Inefficiency**: Retransmissions and failed deliveries waste limited battery resources
- **Network Congestion**: Poor latency prediction can exacerbate congestion issues
- **Application Performance**: Real-time applications require predictable network behavior

### 1.3 Project Objective

This project aims to develop and evaluate a machine learning-based approach for predicting packet delivery latency categories in WSNs. Specifically, we employ a Random Forest classifier to predict whether packet delivery will fall into Low, Medium, or High latency categories based on various network parameters.

### 1.4 Scope and Significance

The significance of this work lies in its potential to:

- Enable proactive network management and optimization
- Improve resource allocation strategies
- Enhance QoS for time-sensitive applications
- Provide insights into the most influential network parameters affecting latency
- Support adaptive routing algorithms and congestion control mechanisms

## 2. Problem Definition

### 2.1 Formal Problem Statement

The core problem addressed in this study is the multi-class classification of packet delivery latency in WSNs. Formally, given a set of network features **X** = {x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ}, we aim to predict the latency category **y** ∈ {Low Latency, Medium Latency, High Latency}.

This prediction problem is mathematically expressed as:
**f: X → Y**

Where **f** is the learned mapping function (Random Forest classifier) that maps input features to latency categories.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Preprocessing Pipeline

The data preprocessing phase involved several critical steps to prepare the dataset for machine learning:

**Missing Value Handling:**
- Applied `dropna()` method to remove instances with missing values
- Ensured data completeness for reliable model training

**Categorical Variable Encoding:**
The following categorical features were transformed using Label Encoding:
- Node_ID → Numerical labels
- Congestion_Status → {0: Low, 1: Medium, 2: High}
- Traffic_Class → {0: Normal, 1: High-Priority}
- Routing_Algorithm → {0: AODV, 1: DCPO-AdaBoost, 2: DSR, 3: OLSR}
- Latency_Category → {0: Low, 1: Medium, 2: High}

**Feature Scaling:**
Numerical features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure equal contribution during model training:
```
X_scaled = (X - μ) / σ
```
Where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.

**Dataset Splitting:**
- Training set: 80% (800 samples)
- Test set: 20% (200 samples)
- Stratified sampling maintained class distribution across splits

### 3.2 Random Forest Algorithm

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to create a robust classifier. The algorithm operates on two key principles:

**Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging):**
Each decision tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of the training data, introducing diversity among trees and reducing overfitting.

**Feature Randomness:**
At each node split, only a random subset of features is considered, typically √(number of features), further increasing diversity.

**Prediction Mechanism:**
For classification, the final prediction is determined by majority voting among all trees:
```
Prediction = mode(Tree₁, Tree₂, ..., Treeₙ)
```

### 3.3 Hyperparameter Optimization

GridSearchCV was employed to optimize the following hyperparameters:

**Parameter Grid:**
- `n_estimators`: [100, 200] - Number of trees in the forest
- `max_depth`: [None, 10, 20] - Maximum depth of individual trees
- `min_samples_split`: [2, 5] - Minimum samples required to split internal nodes

**Cross-Validation:**
- 3-fold cross-validation was used for hyperparameter evaluation
- Scoring metric: Accuracy
- Best parameters were selected based on cross-validated performance

### 3.4 Model Training Process

The final model training process involved:

1. **Data Loading:** Import preprocessed dataset with encoded features
2. **Feature-Target Separation:** Separate input features (X) from target variable (y)
3. **Grid Search Execution:** Systematic hyperparameter optimization
4. **Best Model Selection:** Choose configuration with highest cross-validated accuracy
5. **Final Training:** Train the best model on the entire training set
6. **Model Persistence:** Save the trained model for future use

| 2 (High Latency) | 89% | 92% | 91% | 78 |

### 5.2 Confusion Matrix Analysis

The confusion matrix reveals strong prediction capabilities with minimal misclassification:

**Key Observations:**
- **Class 0 (Low Latency)**: 67 correct predictions, 5 misclassified as High Latency
- **Class 1 (Medium Latency)**: 46 correct predictions, 4 misclassified (evenly split)
- **Class 2 (High Latency)**: 72 correct predictions, 6 misclassified (3 each as Low and Medium)

**Misclassification Patterns:**
The model shows slight difficulty distinguishing between extreme categories (Low vs. High), suggesting these cases may represent edge conditions where multiple factors contribute to latency determination.

### 5.3 Feature Importance Analysis

Based on the Random Forest feature importance scores, the most influential network parameters are:

**Top Contributing Features:**
1. **Transmission_Delay** (~65% importance): Dominates prediction, indicating direct correlation with latency categories
2. **Buffer_Occupancy** (~8% importance): Network congestion indicator
3. **Energy_Level** (~6% importance): Resource availability impact
4. **Link_Quality** (~5% importance): Connection reliability factor
5. **Channel_Utilization** (~5% importance): Network load indicator

**Less Influential Features:**
Node_ID, PDR, Hop_Count, Packet_Size, Routing_Algorithm, Congestion_Status, and Traffic_Class showed relatively lower importance, suggesting latency is primarily determined by immediate transmission characteristics rather than network topology or protocol choices.

### 5.4 ROC Curve Analysis

The ROC curves demonstrate exceptional model discrimination:

**AUC Scores:**
- **Class 0**: AUC = 1.00 (Perfect discrimination)
- **Class 1**: AUC = 0.99 (Near-perfect discrimination)
